Digital version of the code that prohibits ads flooding to my letterbox.

Soon as I moved to a new apartment the flood of spam, ads, and free newspapers (mostly filled with ads) flooded my apartment. 
My lovely girlfriend made me a sing that I put on the door above the letterbox. No more ads!
Even the code sign is nice I know some of you wanna point out how there is no `<title>` or doctype is not defined. 

This repo is the place to do that and who knows if you are kind enough when writing your issues she might be up for a patched version.
